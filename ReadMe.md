## Simple MCP9808 example on Pi PicoW

Written in C using the pico sdk, all it does at the moment is read the temperature every second.

The plan is to post it to the GateHouseMonitor lambda, so we have two monitors.

Then, make sure the picow is using a battery so we can stick it in the loft.

That's it, at the moment.
